abap2UI5 is an open-source project providing a pure ABAP approach for developing UI5 Apps without the need for Javascript, OData and RAP - similar to the past, when only a few lines of ABAP were needed to display inputs and tables using Selection Screens and ALVs. The project is designed with a minimal system footprint and runs in both on-premise and cloud environments.
